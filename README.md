# Adaptive Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection (AMMAD)

A production-grade anomaly detection framework built for heterogeneous cloud environments. This project fuses logs, metrics, and traces using hybrid ML models with self-evolving feedback loops for drift adaptation.

##  System Overview

This repository includes:
- A full whitepaper-style explanation of the architecture
- Hands-on PoC implementation using Isolation Forest + Autoencoders
- Diagrams for ingestion, feature fusion, and model serving
- Future-forward extensions with Transformers and causal overlays

> ⚠️ This system is designed to scale with AWS-native infrastructure (Kafka, Lambda, S3, SageMaker) and integrates into CI/CD with explainable ML outputs.

##  Architecture Diagram

See `/architecture/AMMAD_architecture.png`

## Getting Started

To run the proof-of-concept demo:

```bash
cd src/
python anomaly_detection.py
```

Outputs anomaly detections over time and saves visualization to `anomaly_detection_results.png`.

##  Future Work

- Transformer fusion layers
- Cost-aware probabilistic alerting
- Causal graph overlays for RCA
