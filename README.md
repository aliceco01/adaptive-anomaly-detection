# Adaptive Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection

This project implements a self-evolving hybrid ML framework for detecting anomalies in cloud telemetry by fusing metrics, logs, and traces.  
It demonstrates how to simulate telemetry data, extract features, detect anomalies, and explain their root causes using explainable AI techniques.
